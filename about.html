<h3>West Harlem</h3>
<p>
The Westside of Manhattan between 125th Street and around 160th Street contains several pocket neighborhoods and can be called different names depending on who you talk to. Among these are Sugar Hill, The Grange, Hamilton Heights and way back when, it was also known as the Gold Coast. Most people who've been there a long time just call it West Harlem. But that may be because they don't want you to know where they live exactly.

<h4>City College</h4>
<img src="images/CCNY_01_sm.jpg"><p>For over a hundred years, City College has defined the neighborhood’s landscape. Its neo-Gothic structures, decorated with terra cotta gargoyles, reach above the surrounding architecture. The sides of the campus are marked with four gates: Hudson Gate (Amsterdam Avenue), Alexander Hamilton Gate (Convent Avenue), George Washington Gate (138th Street and Convent Avenue), and Peter Stuyvesant Gate (St. Nicholas Terrace).

<h4>Riverbank State Park</h4>
<p>
Of the several parks in the area, the largest and most impressive is certainly Riverbank State Park off of Riverside Drive, between 138th and 145th. Named for its place on the Hudson River. The park was constructed on top of a sewage treatment facility, in response to residents’ complaints about the facility’s location. Its design was inspired by Japanese urban rooftop architecture. The park’s twenty-eight acres hold a rink for ice-skating and roller-blading, carousel, running track, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a restaurant, among other attractions.
